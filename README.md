# Climbing-The-Ladder

## Project Overview
Climbing the Ladder is a satirical comedy project designed to poke fun at workplace dynamics, particularly the prioritization of superficial qualities over merit and the omission of neurodiversity. The project uses an interactive questionnaire to simulate a workplace evaluation, guided by your "Lovely AI line manager." Through witty and sarcastic tones, it highlights how often arbitrary factors are emphasized in professional growth while more meaningful attributes are overlooked.

## Features
- **Dynamic Tone**: Alternates between friendly and sassy commentary to keep the experience engaging and humorous.
- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Users answer questions about ambition, networking, and popularity, receiving tailored responses based on their choices.
- **Score-Based Feedback**: Users accumulate scores that reflect their "success potential," adding a comedic twist to workplace evaluations.
- **Restart Functionality**: Users can restart the questionnaire and try different approaches to see how their scores change.

## Satirical Themes
1. **Neurodiversity Omission**: Highlights how workplace assessments often ignore unique cognitive styles and strengths of neurodivergent individuals.
2. **Superficial Metrics**: Critiques the emphasis on networking and popularity over genuine skills and contributions.
3. **Artificial Evaluations**: Parodies the over-reliance on AI and algorithms for personal and professional evaluations.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the project, including responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity, including question transitions, score calculations, and restarting functionality.
