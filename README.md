# Climbing-The-Ladder

## Project Overview
Climbing the Ladder is a satirical comedy project designed to poke fun at workplace dynamics, particularly the prioritization of superficial qualities over merit and the omission of neurodiversity. The project uses an interactive questionnaire to simulate a workplace evaluation, guided by your "Lovely AI line manager." Through witty and sarcastic tones, it highlights how often arbitrary factors are emphasized in professional growth while more meaningful attributes are overlooked.

## Features
- **Dynamic Tone**: Alternates between friendly and sassy commentary to keep the experience engaging and humorous.
- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Users answer questions about ambition, networking, and popularity, receiving tailored responses based on their choices.
- **Score-Based Feedback**: Users accumulate scores that reflect their "success potential," adding a comedic twist to workplace evaluations.
- **Restart Functionality**: Users can restart the questionnaire and try different approaches to see how their scores change.
- **Score-Based Feedback**: Users accumulate scores that reflect their "success potential," adding a comedic twist to workplace evaluations.(Ongoing)

## Satirical Themes
1. **Neurodiversity Omission**: Highlights how workplace assessments often ignore unique cognitive styles and strengths of neurodivergent individuals.
2. **Superficial Metrics**: Critiques the emphasis on networking and popularity over genuine skills and contributions.
3. **Artificial Evaluations**: Parodies the over-reliance on AI and algorithms for personal and professional evaluations.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the project, including responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity, including question transitions, score calculations, and restarting functionality.
- **Python (Flask)**: Used to build the backend, facilitating communication with OpenAI's API for generating feedback dynamically (backend hosting is a work in progress).
- **OpenAI API**: Generates sassy or friendly feedback based on user scores, enhancing the humor and interactivity.(Ongoing)

 ## Ongoing Improvements For AI Section 
- **Integration of Flask Backend**: The backend is currently being developed using Flask to enable smooth communication between the app and OpenAI’s API. Hosting the backend securely is a priority, and solutions for managing API key security are being explored.
  
- **AI-Driven Feedback**: Leveraging OpenAI’s models, the app generates responses that adapt to the user's scores, alternating between sassy and friendly tones to create an engaging experience.

- **Text-to-Speech Feature**: A planned feature where a static AI avatar will read out the questions using tones that match the generated feedback, enhancing interactivity and accessibility.

- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Using Matplotlib to compare user performance against the "perfect employee," making the evaluation process more interactive and analytical.

## How to Run the Project
You can view the live demo [here](https://cleo469.github.io/Climbing-The-Ladder/)

## Or

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Click "Start Now" to begin the questionnaire.
4. Answer the questions and view your results.
5. Restart the quiz to try a different approach.

## Known Issues
- **Button Placement**: The "Start Now" button may require adjustment if restarting doesn’t reset its position correctly.
- **Limited Questions**: Currently, the questionnaire includes three categories (Ambition, Networking, Popularity). Future updates may expand the content.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Ensure compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Expanded Questions**: Add more categories and questions to deepen the satire.
- **Leaderboard**: Introduce a humorous leaderboard to compare "success potential" scores.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the absurdities often encountered in professional environments, aiming to bring humor and awareness to these issues. Special thanks to anyone who laughs or reflects while "Climbing The Ladder"!
